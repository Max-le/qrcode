# qrcode
Pythpn code to generate QR codes


Require the python packages qrcode and pillow.

The folder V1 contains a virtual environment with thoses packages installed. ( Why bother with that ? http://bit.ly/2qfyVwf )

To get into this virtual environment, the file "activate" must be executed : 
'''

source path\to\activate

'''

For example : 
```
source /Users/max/Documents/GitHub/qrcode/V1/bin/activate 
```
