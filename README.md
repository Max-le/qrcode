Python code to generate QR codes.


Require the python packages qrcode and pillow.
Documentation : https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/

The folder V1 contains a virtual environment with thoses packages installed. ( Why bother with that ? http://bit.ly/2qfyVwf )

To get into this virtual environment, the file "activate" must be executed : 
```
source path\to\activate
```
One in the environment, you should see (V1) before every command.
